# LightSwitch

## About this extension

This is a FireFox extension will check the time of the user and change the theme of the browser (or page) accordingly. During morning times, the theme will reflect a lighter color scheme (a morning shift), and durning the night time there will be a darker color scheme (night shift).

The lightswitch extension detects the time of day. If it is day time, the decoration that lights up the website is turned off. During the night time, the decoration is turned off. This can be done both automatically (the computer will periodically check the user time) or manually. If the user chooses, the lights can be turn on or off.
